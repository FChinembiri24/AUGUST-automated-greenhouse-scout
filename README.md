#AUGUST(AUtomated GreenhoUse ScouT)#

This repository contains the code for an automated plant disease detection robot. The robot uses a line follower Arduino robot for navigation, MobileNet for image classification, and the OpenCV library for computer vision. The algorithm was trained using TensorFlow.

Requirements
Arduino IDE
OpenCV library
TensorFlow
Installation
Clone the repository to your local machine.
Install the Arduino IDE and the OpenCV library.
Install TensorFlow.
Usage
Open the lfr.ino file in the Arduino IDE.
Select the correct board and port.
Upload the code to the Arduino.
Run the opencvfilefinal.py script.
The robot will now start navigating around the plants, taking images, and classifying them for disease.
